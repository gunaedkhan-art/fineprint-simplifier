    fix: critical CSS class mismatch in visitor summary display
    
     CRITICAL FIX - CSS Class Mismatch Resolved:
    
     Root Cause Identified:
    - HTML was using 'summary-stat' class
    - CSS was defining 'visitor-summary-stat' class
    - This caused the results to have no styling and appear invisible
    
     Fixed HTML Structure:
    - Changed 'summary-stat' to 'visitor-summary-stat'
    - Updated to use proper h3/p tags instead of div.stat-number/div.stat-label
    - Added 'risks' and 'good-points' classes for proper color styling
    
     Result:
    - Visitor summary should now display properly
    - Results will be visible with correct styling
    - Backend was working correctly all along
    
     This explains why:
    - Backend found 2 risks and 5 good points correctly
    - Frontend showed 'No risks or good points found'
    - CSS classes didn't match, so results were invisible
