# Railway PostgreSQL Setup - REQUIRED FOR DATA PERSISTENCE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status
Your application is currently using SQLite, which **WILL LOSE ALL DATA** on every Railway deployment.

## üö® URGENT: Still Seeing SQLite Warning?

If you've added PostgreSQL but still see the SQLite warning:

### Check #1: Is PostgreSQL Service Added?
1. In Railway Dashboard, look for a service named **"PostgreSQL"** in your project
2. If you don't see it, you need to add it (see Step 1 below)

### Check #2: Is DATABASE_URL Set?
1. In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Variables** tab
2. Look for a variable named `DATABASE_URL`
3. **If missing:** Railway hasn't automatically set it up
4. **To fix:** 
   - Click on your PostgreSQL service
   - Go to the **"Connect"** tab
   - Copy the connection string (starts with `postgresql://`)
   - Go back to your main service ‚Üí Variables tab
   - Add new variable: Name = `DATABASE_URL`, Value = (paste the connection string)
   - Redeploy

### Check #3: Did You Redeploy?
After adding the variable, you MUST redeploy:
1. Go to your main service in Railway
2. Click the "..." menu ‚Üí **"Redeploy"**
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Check logs for: `‚úÖ Using PostgreSQL - data will persist across deployments`

## ‚úÖ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Add PostgreSQL Database to Railway

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click on your **fineprint_simplifier** project
3. Click **"+ New"** button (top right)
4. Select **"Database"**
5. Select **"Add PostgreSQL"**

Railway will automatically:
- Create a new PostgreSQL service
- Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Connect it to your application

### Step 2: Verify the Setup

1. In your Railway project, go to the **"Variables"** tab
2. Look for a variable named `DATABASE_URL`
3. It should look like: `postgresql://postgres:password@hostname:port/database`

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Railway will automatically detect the new `DATABASE_URL` variable
2. Your next deployment will use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
3. Check the deployment logs for: `‚úÖ Using PostgreSQL - data will persist across deployments`

## üéØ What This Fixes

After adding PostgreSQL:
- ‚úÖ User accounts will persist across deployments
- ‚úÖ Usage tracking will persist across deployments
- ‚úÖ No more data loss on deployment
- ‚úÖ Your account won't disappear after updates

## üîç Verify It's Working

After deployment, check the logs for:
```
‚úÖ Database connection successful: postgresql://...
‚úÖ Using PostgreSQL - data will persist across deployments
```

If you see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Using SQLite - data will NOT persist on Railway deployments
```
Then the `DATABASE_URL` variable is not set correctly.

## üí∞ Cost

Railway's PostgreSQL database is included in their free tier with:
- 512 MB storage
- More than enough for user accounts and usage tracking
- No credit card required for free tier

## üìù Troubleshooting

### Database URL Not Appearing
1. Make sure you added PostgreSQL as a **Service** to your project
2. Check the **Variables** tab - `DATABASE_URL` should be automatically set
3. If missing, click on the PostgreSQL service ‚Üí Connect tab ‚Üí Copy the connection string
4. Manually add it as an environment variable in your main service

### Still Using SQLite
1. Check that `DATABASE_URL` starts with `postgresql://` not `sqlite://`
2. Redeploy your application after setting the variable
3. Check deployment logs to confirm PostgreSQL is being used

### Need Help?
If you're still seeing the SQLite warning after following these steps, the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable may not be set correctly. Check the Railway dashboard Variables tab.
